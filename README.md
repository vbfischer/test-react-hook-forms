# test-react-hook-forms
A simple test of using an embedded form inside another using react-hook-forms

Experimenting with the best way to embed a simple form inside another form. Goal is to keep implementation
details out of the embedded form. I'd like to treat it like just another "control" that the react-hook-form library sees.
